# My Career Map

Hello, I’m [Pooja Devan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pooja-devan-07nov95/), and I’ve spent over six years crafting technical content. Welcome to my online space!

## From Word Docs to Docs-as-Code

Many journeys take surprising turns, and mine was no exception. I wanted to be a journalist, but being Asian, my parents had other plans. So I became an engineer !!

While studying Electronics and Communications, I realized I didn’t want to build circuits, I wanted to build clarity. That’s when I stumbled into technical writing, a field that let me blend my curiosity for technology with my love for words. The rest, as they say, is documentation.

## Chapter 1: The WordPress Years

I started my career writing content for websites, fact-filled articles, product descriptions, and blog posts. I worked with tools like **WordPress**, **MS Word**, and **Canva**, and began learning how to structure content for digital platforms. During this time, I also started creating **technical explainer videos** using **Camtasia**. That was my first taste of teaching through content and I loved it.

## Chapter 2: Getting Technical

At [SemaConnect](https://blinkcharging.com/blog/semaconnect-welcome-to-blink-charging) and [ZKTeco](https://www.zkteco.com/en/), I moved into more structured documentation, writing manuals, user guides, and software help modules in **HTML**, working closely with product and engineering teams. I also collaborated with UX teams and helped shape the voice of the product. Tools like **Snagit**, **Adobe XD**, and **Figma** became part of my everyday toolkit. I was still growing into the title of "technical writer," but the path was getting clearer.

## Chapter 3: Owning the Docs

Then came [Skan AI](https://www.skan.ai/), where I joined as the first and only technical writer. There was no documentation system, so I built one from scratch using **Document360**. I defined the architecture, structured the content, and built workflows that supported an agile development process. I even helped train the company’s chatbot and wrote its responses. This was the job where I really learned what it means to own the documentation function not just write, but advocate, organize, and scale.

## Chapter 4: Docs-as-Code and Developer Workflows

At [Pixitmedia](https://www.pixitmedia.com/), I stepped fully into the world of **docs-as-code**. I write in **Markdown** and **reStructuredText**, generate documentation using **Sphinx**, and collaborate via **Git** and **Bitbucket**, just like the developers. I submit pull requests, review code-adjacent content, and ship docs alongside product releases as part of the CI/CD pipeline. I also work comfortably in a **Linux** environment and manage docs in sync with **Jira**, **Confluence**, and release cycles.

## What I've Learned Along the Way

Every company I’ve worked with has used a different tool or workflow **Document360, RoboHelp, WordPress, Slite, Sphinx, GitHub Pages** but I’ve never let that slow me down. I learn fast, adapt quickly, and bring a structured approach no matter what tool I’m handed. Whether I’m writing for end users, developers, or internal teams, I focus on what really matters: **making the content useful, clear, and easy to find**.

This journey from aspiring journalist to engineer to technical writer, has been unconventional but deeply rewarding. Now, I’m exactly where I want to be: helping teams build better products through better documentation.
